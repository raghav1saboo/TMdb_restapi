## Introduction
TMdb_restapi is a RESTful API built to interact with The Movie Database (TMdb) and provide access to movie information. This API offers a straightforward way to retrieve data about movies, including details like movie titles, release dates, ratings, and more.

## Objective
The main objectives of this project are:
- Create a user-friendly RESTful API to interact with TMdb's vast movie database.
- Allow users to access essential movie details through simple API calls.
- Provide a convenient alternative to directly querying the TMdb API.

## Features
- Retrieve a list of popular movies.
- Get movie details by providing the movie ID.
- Search for movies based on various parameters like title, year, genre, etc.
- Fetch movie cast and crew information.
- Access movie trailers and videos.

## Technologies Used
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Axios (for making HTTP requests)
- TMdb API (as the data source)

## Installation
To set up the TMdb_restapi locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/raghav1saboo/TMdb_restapi.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd TMdb_restapi
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies using npm:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Obtain an API key from The Movie Database (TMdb) and store it securely (e.g., in a .env file).

## Usage
1. Start the server by running the following command:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

2. The API will now be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` by default.

3. Use tools like Postman or curl to make API requests and receive movie information.
